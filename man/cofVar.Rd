\title{Calculating the coefficient of variation for expression matrix.}
\usage{
cofVar(data, complete = TRUE, treatment = NULL, type = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The whole normalized expression matrix, rows: genes or probeset, columns: samples, it may be stored in a SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{complete}{Boolean to define if the function uses the whole expression matrix, by default TRUE.}

\item{treatment}{A numeric vector with 0s and 1s for each sample in the expression matrix, the 0 expresses the control samples and 1 expresses the case samples, by default is NULL.}

\item{type}{It can be "case" to calculate the mean and the coefficient of variation for the case samples or, otherwise, "control" to obtain these two values for the control samples.}
}
\value{
The expression matrix with two new columns, the first one with the averages and the other one with the coefficient of variation values.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean and the coefficient of variation to each row 
(genes or probesets) in an expression matrix in two ways: i) in the whole matrix ii) for the specific phenotype (case or control).
}
\examples{

## Creating the expression matrix

# The matrix have 200 genes and 20 samples

n <- 200
m <- 20

# The vector with treatment and control samples

t <- c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))

# Calculating the expression values normalized

mat <- as.matrix(rexp(n, rate = 1))
norm <- t(apply(mat, 1, function(nm) rnorm(m, mean=nm, sd=1)))

## Calculating the mean and the coefficient of variation

# For the whole expression matrix

complete <- cofVar(norm)
head(complete)

# For the case samples

case <- cofVar(data = norm,complete = FALSE,treatment = t,type = "case")
head(case)
