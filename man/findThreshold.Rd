\title{Find the threshold value to create a co-expression network}
\usage{
findThreshold(difexp, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{difexp}{A whole expression matrix or the expression matrix to differentially expressed genes.}

\item{method}{The method name to create the correlation matrix, this can be "correlation" to obtain the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. On the other hand, can be "mutual information" to obtain the correlation values from an entropy-based method.}
}
\value{
The best threshold value found using the two criteria and a plot showing the result.
}
\description{
Finds the threshold value to establish the cutoff in the process to define the edges in the co-expression network final from two steps. In the first one, obtains the subtraction from clustering coefficient values of the real and random networks created from the possible threshold values in the correlation matrix. In the second one, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is made to evaluate the degree distribution respect normality.
