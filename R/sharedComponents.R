#' @title Finding shared components between diferent networks.
#' @description From the intersection network, obtains the nodes without any degree value. These are the shared molecular components without any biological relation among them.
#' @param ... The networks (igraph objects) to obtain the shared components.
#' @return A vector with the names of the shared components.
#' @examples 
#' # Loading data

#' data("net1")
