Description: Extract gene expression from GEO DataSets database like a AffyBatch object. Furthermore, can makes normalization process using two different methods (vsn and rma), Summarizing using two different criteria (Maximum  value and Median of the sample data) and the process of gene differentially expressed using two methods (sam and acde). The construction of the co-expression network to be able to conduced using two different methods, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) or Mutual Information (MI) and choosing a threshold value using a new proposed method.
